/*
Sehwag has been solving a lot of mathematical problems recently. He was learning ETF (Euler Totient Function) and found the topic quite interesting. So, he tried solving a question on ETF. He will be given two numbers L and R. He has to find the probability that the ETF of a number in the range [L, R] is divisible by a number K.
Input:
The first line contains the number of test cases i.e. T.
The next T lines will contain three integers L, R and K.
Output:
Print the answer in a new line after rounding off the first 6 digits after the decimal place.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= L <= R <= 10^12
0 <= R - L <= 10^5
1 <= K <= 10^6
Sample Input:
3
1 4 2
2 5 2
3 10 4
Sample Output:
0.500000
0.750000
0.375000
