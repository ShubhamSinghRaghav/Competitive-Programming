/*
Given the value of N, you will have to find the value of G. 
The meaning of G is given in the following code
G=0;
for(i = 1 ; i < N ; i++)
   for(j = i+1 ; j <= N ; j++) 
       G+=gcd(i,j);
Here gcd() is a function that finds the greatest common divisor of the two input numbers.
Input
The input file contains at most 20000 lines of inputs. 
Each line contains an integer N (1 < N < 1000001). 
The meaning of N is given in the problem statement. 
Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero.
Output
For each line of input produce one line of output. 
This line contains the value of G for the corresponding N. 
The value of G will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
Sample Input:
10
100
200000
0
Sample Output:
67
13015
143295493160
